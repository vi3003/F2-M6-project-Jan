# F2-M6-project-Jan
 A gallery using flex layout that displays 4 images in a single row.
 
 When the first image is clicked, a form appears where the user can register themselves by providing their name, email, and username.
 
 The registered person's name and username should be displayed when the second image is clicked.
 
 When the third image is clicked, it displays a picture of a dice. On clicking the dice, it generates a random number between 1 and 6. The user is to click the dice 3     times. If the sum of the three generated values is greater than 10, the user will be able to click the fourth image. If the sum is not greater than 10, the user will     be prompted to try again after scoring more than 10.
 
 When the fourth image is clicked, a random 12-digit text is generated as a coupon.
 
 The images can only be clicked once and in a specific order (from first to last). Once an image has been clicked, it can not be clicked again.
 
 If the user does not score more than 10 on their first attempt, they will be given one more chance to click the third and fourth images.
 
 If the user fails to score more than 10 even after their second attempt, a "Bad luck" message is displayed and no other chance is given.
 
 If the user can generate a coupon, a congratulatory image displayed. [10 marks]
